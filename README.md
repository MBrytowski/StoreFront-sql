## Instructions

User can load the application by entering `node bamazonCustomer.js`. This code displays the available inventory and asks which 
item ID the user would like to purchase. In the below screenshot, if the user selects an item ID that does not exist. The application displays an error "Product is not available. Please choose a valid ID." and then re-displays the available inventory.
